# HLTV NEWS Discord Bot

## üìå What does this script do?
This Python script fetches the latest news from an RSS feed (by default, [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org/)) and automatically sends them to a **Discord channel** using a webhook.  
The bot formats the message with:
- Title (clickable link to the article)
- Description (including player quotes if available)
- News image
- Publish date and time  

This way, you always have the latest news in your Discord server.

## üîÑ Can I use it with other RSS feeds?
Yes ‚úÖ  
You can use **any RSS feed URL**, not just HLTV.  
To change the feed, edit this line in the script:
```python
RSS_URL = "https://www.hltv.org/rss/news"
```
Replace it with the RSS link of any website, blog, or service that provides RSS.
